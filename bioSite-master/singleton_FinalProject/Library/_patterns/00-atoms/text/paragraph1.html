        Nicollette Grace Singleton was born on March 3rd, 1995 in Blair, Nebraska. Her parents, Noelle 
        and Terry, raised her to be an adventurous, active, and curious child. She grew up mostly in 
        Omaha, Nebraska and Helena, Montana, where she throughout her childhood played soccer. She also 
        constantly went hiking, biking, mountain climbing, snowboarding, scuba diving, caving, and 
        anything else she could get her hands on that was new and different. Not only was she highly 
        interested in everything outdoors, but she also loved school, and more specifically, animals 
        and biology. Her favorite study in biology was animals, especially sharks. Her favorite shark 
        is the Blue Shark, and to this day she can spout hundreds of facts and species of sharks that 
        nearly no one would know. After High School, she attended the University of Nebraska Kearney. 
        In the year 2017, Nicollette met her husband Justin. They got two little Yorkshire Terriers (her 
        favorite) and named them Milo and Teddy. Later that year they decided to get married, and quickly 
        er that they conceived. On July 25th, 2018 their daughter Elizabeth Grace Singleton was born. 
        Nowadays, Nicollette spends her time being the best mother and wife this world has ever seen, 
        and she continues to study all types of sciences. She plans to some day either work in the 
        medical field or in a Psychology based profession, and to move somewhere a little warmer than 
        Montana or Nebraska. If there was one word to describe Nicollette, it would be caring. She is 
        caring to every single animal, person, or thing, and that is why she is worthy of her story 
        being told.
